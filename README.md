Efficient Data Storage with NumPy Structured Arrays

​Problem: Standard Python lists are flexible but memory-inefficient for large datasets.

​Solution: Implemented NumPy Structured Arrays to mimic C-style structs. This allows for storing mixed data types (Strings, Integers, Floats) in a single continuous block of memory.

​Result: Achieved significantly lower memory overhead and enabled vectorized operations (filtering/calculations) without using slow Python loops.
